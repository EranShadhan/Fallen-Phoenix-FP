 ifc_economy:0 "International Financial Commission"
 ifc_economy_desc:0 "The International Financial Commission or I.F.C is a commission established by Italy, France and Britain to enforce our repayment of debt. Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary became members of the I.F.C a few years later as well, because of the enormous amount of debt we owed to repay. Luckuly, our neutrality in the Great war allowed us to focus onto repaying our debts. The Enossis and annexation of Cyprus was a significant boost in our economy and allowed us to better work towards paying our debt. The war of 1925 may had been costly, but taking Smyrnia and the Straights under our control, both of which are important harbors, doubled our economy's power and we can pay them off faster. Similar to the International Financial Commission of Inquiry founded by Russia, Britain anf France a century ago, it is meant to guide us through our financial crisis. But let's be honest, it is a known secret that the I.F.C controls our financial decisions. Because of this, every person in Greece has been calling it the International Financial Control."

If we can pay off our debts, it will surely go a long way in securing some semblance of economic stability in Greece. Alternatively, certain radical movements have been known to buck both political and economic conventions. Should we fold to one of these movements, or simply allow the world to unravel as time progresses, more drastic courses of action may very well present themselves...\n\n§YDebt§! to the §YBritish§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentageBritain]\n\n§YDebt§! to the §YFrench§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentageFrance] \n\n§YDebt§! to the §YItalians§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentageItaly] \n\n§YDebt§! to the §YRussians§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentageRussia]\n\n§YDebt§! to the §YGermans§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentagGermany]\n\n§YDebt§! to the §YAustro-Hungarians§!: [ROOT.GetDebtPercentageAustriaHungary] \n\nTotal §YDebt§!
