 ifc_economy_desc:0 "The International Financial Commission or I.F.C is a commission established by Italy, France and Britain to enforce our repayment of debt. Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary became members of the I.F.C a few years later as well, because of the enormous amount of debt we owed to repay. Luckuly, our neutrality in the Great war allowed us to focus onto repaying our debts. The Enossis and annexation of Cyprus was a significant boost in our economy and allowed us to better work towards paying our debt. The war of 1925 may had been costly, but taking Smyrnia and the Straights under our control, both of which are important harbors, doubled our economy's power and we can pay them off faster. Similar to the International Financial Commission of Inquiry founded by Russia, Britain anf France a century ago, it is meant to guide us through our financial crisis. But let's be honest, it is a known secret that the I.F.C controls our financial decisions. Because of this, every person in Greece has been calling it the International Financial Control."

 #GRE_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "After The Weltkrieg, Greece was gifted for its neutrality by being given Cyprus. Venizelos left in self-exile out of embarrasment, leaving the King's regency to continue unintercepted. When the Second Great Turkish War started, Venizelos returned hoping to gain support. But Ioannis Metaxas, a young officer and politician, managed to outvote Venizelos within the party. Both the King's and Metaxas' power has been growing and a class between them seems unavoidable. The EEE, seeing Greece's success, believes the restoration of Byzantium is possible and have gained a lot of popularity within the nation."
 GRE_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Greece remained neutral in the Great war due to the split between the Prime Minister and the King. A decision was never made because the Germans already won. The Germans granted Greece all of Cyprus as a reward for their neutrality, which made the King more popular in Greece. \n\nGreece and Bulgaria were surrounded by Great Powers and to streangthen themselfs they created the Salonika Pact with Albania. In the Second Great Turkish War fought alongside the Salonika Pact Greece gained Constantinople and Smyrna and allowed population exchanges with the Turks."
