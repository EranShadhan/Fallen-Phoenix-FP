 SOV_alex_kerensky_desc:0 "Born in 1881 in Simbirsk, Alexander was always the curious one. His father Fyodor was a director of a gymnasium closeby and his grandfather served as a priest. His father has teached someone who now goes by a name heard all over the world: Vladimir Lenin. Though his real surname is Ulyanov, not much know it.\n\nWhen Alexander was only eight years old, he and his family moved to Tashkent, the capital of Russian Turkestan. Ten years later Alexander graduated with honours and moved to Saint Petersburg to receive higher education in history and philology.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg Kerensky truly began to open himself up to politics. First, he joined the Narodnik movement and helped victims of the revolution of 1905. Though his work would end with his first imprisonment: he was put into jail as the officials were suspicious of him being a member of a militant group. After his release he throroughly learned law and gained a reputation of being a genius attorney for revolutionaries those charged with treason. \n\nAfter seven years of working as a lawyer, Kerensky was elected into the Fourth Duma as a representative of the Trudoviks, who were a mere branch of the wider Socialist Revolutionary party. The same year he joined a Freemason society.\n\nAnd then the bells of war rang.\n\nAfter the fall of Paris the Duma knew that Russia stands no chance. Panic erupted in the governing body.\n\nKerensky knew what to do.\n\nHe was quick to seize the opportunity and overthrow the Tsarist regime, rallying the people behind him. The coup of 1915 was an irreversible moment in Russian history which will be remembered  forever. The first thing he did is completely eliminate the remnants of the Imperial Thought. Madman Rasputin - Executed. The Romanovs - Executed. Tsarist supporters - Imprisoned. When his old family friend tried to start a Bolshevik revolution he was forced to leave Russia. Kerensky's Provisional Government was a major success in its early years.\n\nThough soon people would begin to grow discontent. The Baltic War was a total disaster and the civilians started to catch on the Kerensky's allegedly Provisional government is doing nothing to transition to an actual democracy. Separatist cells grew - Kerensky suppressed them. Now, he stands as an upholder of a precarious balance. He has to play his cards wisely. Or he will lose everything."
