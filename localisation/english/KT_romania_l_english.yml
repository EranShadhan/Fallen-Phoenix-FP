kt_romania.15.t:0 "The Ukrainians refuse"
kt_romania.15.d:0 "While we tried to convince the Ukrainian government to cede the land to us, it was useless as they refused every single offer we tried. Unable to obtain what we desired our delegate ended the meeting there."

kt_romania.16.t:0 "Ukraine Accepts"
kt_romania.16.d:0 "After a lot of thinking, the Ukrainian government decided to give up their control on Transnistria in exchange for some Money and Resources.
