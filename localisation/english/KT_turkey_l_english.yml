But this title slowly crumbles as nations such as Arabia and Persia rose to prominence. If Turkey wants to sustain its role as a protector, it has to choose itself a new group to protect.

 TUR_start_of_a_new_decade_desc:0 "The 20s was a rough time to be a Turk. All of our issues came crashing down at once. But that is in the past. With the great power set to tear eachother apart once again, we may just have a chance to bounce back."
 TUR_constitution_of_1930_desc:0 "If we are to modernize, we must start with the inside. Constitutional reforms will be the perfect and only start to a new and modern Turkic state."
 TUR_reconvene_the_enguru_parliament_desc:0 "With the constitution now in place, the current regime has to change. Perhaps the old parliament was treated too harshly by the public. Hopefully with recent events, they will stick around much longer this time."
 TUR_the_triumph_of_the_peoples_party_desc:0 "Despite some initial protest, the people have spoken. The constitution is here to stay. There is nothing left to do but get to work. The people have given us their blessing and we cannot let them down."
 TUR_education_modernization_desc:0 "The first step to fixing the state is working on the people. One way to ensure long term stability is to re educate the youth. By modernizing our education system, the problems of the past will never happen again as the brightest minds will one day gather in Konstantiniyye."
 TUR_close_sufi_orders_desc:0 "One of our boldest steps, the Sufi Orders have to go. Widespread practice has slowed our growth to a crawl. The hardline islamists will hate this, but you cannot practice your belief if your country is conquered."
 TUR_reform_the_penal_code_desc:0 "As time marched on, our penal code is stuck in the past, leading to overcrowded prisons with no chance of anyone returning to society. By reforming our code, we can hope that one day the prisoners can be reformed and serve the country once again."
 TUR_abolish_traditional_headgear_desc:0 "So long as our old symbols remain, we will be held back from true greatness. Ending their use will be nothing short of a tedious nightmare, but it will be worth it in the long run."
 TUR_promote_turkish_women_desc:0 "For far too long, the women in our society have been repressed even by European standards. A solid half of the population has been left to rot in their homes. Think of the potential being wasted. By granting them some power, we can raise our overall potential to greater heights."
 TUR_new_civil_code_desc:0 "Some of our civil laws date back to the time of Byzantium. Some for good reason, but most of it is outdated. By westernizing our civil code, we can modernize our society to an acceptable standard."
 TUR_latinization_of_the_turkish_alphabet_desc:0 "Though some may say it's unnecessary we must keep up the process of westernizing our country, including the alphabet. We will hold ourselves to their standard."
 TUR_abolish_traditionalism_desc:0 "We are so close, foreign visitors have noticed our changes and praised them back home. All that is left to do is throw our traditions into the trash and embrace modernity. Then and only then, can we take our rightful place as a great power once again.""
 TUR_monarchy_compromise_desc:0 "Although the Sultan has failed us, he is still a popular figure. Getting rid of him would cause more problems than it would solve. Perhaps granting the monarchists some concessions could silence the opposition."
 TUR_the_sultans_abdication_desc:0 "Monarchism is a thing of the past. It was the Sultan who made us the sick man, It was the Sultan who lost us everything, and it will be the Sultan who falls with the old order."
 TUR_a_true_democracy_desc:0 "As I look at Konstantiniyye, I no longer see a city stuck in the past. I see a modern marvel that even the likes of Berlin and London would be impressed by. The work has been long and hard, perhaps it is time for a hunting trip."
 TUR_ataturk_dies_desc:0 "Extra Extra, Prishtina gunned down by Albanian Assassins, read all about it." Those words were heard all around the world. As the news spread, members of the left and the right, both discontent with the reforms, have made their move. As chaos rains, what happens next is anyone's guess."
 TUR_snap_election_desc:0 "As chaos reigns over Anatolia, a snap election seems to be the only way to return things to some normalcy. For good or for evil, here goes nothing."

 TUR_commies_elected_desc:0 "Our greatest fears have been realized, Turkey has gone red. Alas, there is nothing we can do short of a civil war. All we can do now is watch what they do, and if their radical ideas can last."
 TUR_promote_trade_unions_desc:0 "Despite taking power, the people are still oppressed by the old regimes holdouts. By promoting them, they too can rise and break free of their chains."
 TUR_collectivization_of_agriculture_desc:0 "Even after all this time, the war has left our food supply scarce at best. We must follow the Japanese example and collectivize our food so no man will go without dinner tonight."
 TUR_the_spirit_of_the_workers_desc:0 "The resistance has been ruthless, but we will not yield. The working man must remember what he fights for, and the oppression he once served under. It is not through gods and kings that we will prosper, but the indomitable spirit of the worker."
 TUR_deal_with_the_ultranationalists_desc:0 "Despite being the ones to cause this in the first place, the far right is not content with what has gone down. It is only a matter of time before they try this stunt again and must be silenced before that can happen."
 TUR_deal_with_german_influence_desc:0 "The government in Berlin has been openly opposed and refuses to recognize our regime. Though they have much influence in our state, we must kick them out before they can sponsor any unsavory characters."
 TUR_the_islamic_bastion_of_socialism_desc:0 "With the workers freed, the Muslims among them have begun to spread propaganda of how Socialism is compatible with Islamic values. We must spread these as far and wide as possible to put more doubters to silence."
 TUR_spreading_the_revolution_desc:0 "Though we have been freed, the rest of the middle east is still under oppression. We must build our strength and prepare accordingly so our brothers can also know what freedom is."
 TUR_sponsor_syrian_rebellion_desc:0 "Our first stop in freeing the workers of the Middle East lies to our south. Though historical wounds run deep, we must show them this isn’t a new empire." 
 TUR_alienate_enemies_desc:0 "Though seemingly alone, we command immense respect in the middle east even while weakened. Those who neighbor us and oppose our beliefs must be made to feel alone like the tyrants they are."
 TUR_closer_ties_with_japan_desc:0 "Though seemingly alone in the world, we can at least count on the home of the revolution to hold firm. Japan will be our greatest comrades in the trials to come, we must strive to emulate their warrior spirit for the greater good of our brethren."
 TUR_buy_japanese_guns_desc:0 "The middle east is big, we cannot possibly fund every movement off of Turkish factories alone. Luckily for us, our friends in Japan will be more than happy to supply us with their top of the line weapons."
 TUR_arabic_revolution_desc:0 "With preparations complete, we must turn to our greatest trial yet, Arabia. Though seemingly stronger than us, we have taken appropriate measures to make sure we can combat their influence. We know from first hand experience, keeping all of Arabia together is no easy task."
 TUR_red_crescent_coalition_desc:0  "Though Japan has served us well, they are too far away from us to fight alongside us when push comes to shove. We must form our own alliance more able to fight and defend ourselves from outside threats. A coalition. A coalition to protect and spread the ideas of Kadri and Marx. A coalition to preserve and embrace islamic values. A Coalition of a Red Crescent."
 TUR_free_the_caucasian_workers_desc:0 "Caucasia has spent the last millenia being pushed around by its stronger neighbors. Well no more, it is time they secure their freedom. With this, we finally cleanse ourselves of our sins from the old empire by freeing our former subjects from all oppression."
 TUR_support_persian_communism_desc:0 "Though not part of our old empire, the Persians are just as oppressed as everyone else. It is time we let bygones be bygones and put this millenia old rivalry to rest once and for all."

 TUR_federalists_elected_desc:0 "It seems we had nothing to fear. The federalists have triumphed and the reforms will stick. We must pick up where Prishtina left off for the greater good of not just the Turks, but all of the Middle East."
 TUR_promote_the_turkish_nation_desc:0 "Though beaten down, the recent times have shown we are not out. With the recent bidding war, we will take our place in the sun once again."
 TUR_improve_relations_with_persia_desc:0 "Though our long time rivals, times have changed. Perhaps our shared enemy to our north could be enough of an olive branch to let bygones be bygones for both of our sakes."
 TUR_appeal_to_the_arabians_desc:0 "With conflict on the horizon, our southern neighbor seems like a natural ally. It is only a matter of time until outside forces target them for their massive oil supply. By befriending them, perhaps the black gold can be used to defend us instead of our enemies."
 TUR_create_konya_accords_desc:0 "Though we have been busy befriending our neighbors, most of it has been unofficial and unknown outside of the middle east. By making it official with an alliance, perhaps it will deter any aggression from those who see us as weak."
 TUR_invite_egypt_desc:0 "As one who borders both French and German territory, we have no doubt Egypt would be happy to have allies against them. We must send our diplomats to them at once."
 TUR_cooperate_with_germany_desc:0 "As our greatest trading partner, it is only natural we ally ourselves to the Kaiser. If a united Middle East wasn’t enough to scare off any opponents, this will absolutely do the trick."
 TUR_free_caucasians_from_kerensky_desc:0 "The time has come, our strength has been built and an alliance secured. We are done hiding away from the Russians, we must bring them to heel since it is obvious they will never be content till we are dead."
 TUR_representation_of_the_minorities_desc:0 "Though we have come far, we still face international scrutiny with our treatment of minorities. We must fix this at once before we can truly be called a modern state."
 TUR_recognize_kurdish_citizenship_desc:0 "Outside of the Turks, the Kurds are the largest culture in our state. Granting them citizenship could help silence the constant calls for a Kurdish state."
 TUR_the_islam_compromise_desc:0 "Our previous reforms have been criticized as too draconian against muslims. How can we say we are not oppressing others if we are oppressing our own citizens?"
 TUR_recognize_armenian_citizenship_desc:0 "In recent years, the Armenians have faced more repression and persecution than anyone else in the middle east. Though full reconciliation seems impossible, granting them citizenship would be a nice first step."
 TUR_recognize_pontic_and_greek_citizenship_desc:0 "Even with the Greek conquest of west Anatolia, there are numerous Greeks still living among our ranks who are discontent with this. For the sake of not breaking our vows, we must grant the Greeks citizenship as well."
 TUR_proclaim_the_turkish_federation_desc:0 "With our state united, we can no longer claim to be an old fashioned sultanate. From here on out, we are the Turkish Federation, a state of equals."
 TUR_new_constitution_desc:0 "With the radical changes, the constitution of 1930 is no longer sufficient. We must reform our constitution once again to iron out the outdated and contradictory laws."
 TUR_new_kurdish_home_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, some things will never change. Now that we have less to fear, we can give the Kurds an autonomy of their own, under Turkish supervision of course. We will show our neighbours how proper Liberal Democratic state functions and provide a safe haven for all those who speak Kurdish"
 TUR_request_return_of_izmir_desc:0 "Though seemingly insignificant, Izmir is one of our most important states culturally. We have done much for the Greeks living in our land, it is time they do the same for their Turkish lands.
 TUR_integrate_the_caucasian_states_desc:0 "With the Caucasus taken away from Russian Tyranny, we have much work to do. The people have been russified and their culture repressed. We cannot possibly hope for long term stability with their cultures russified beyond recognition. We must rebuild them from the ground up and remind the caucasus what they once were."

 TUR_the_sultans_grip_remains_firm_desc:0 "Though we could prosper by remaining quiet, that would be a disgrace. The Turks once ruled the world, only to be mocked as 'the sick man.' Even after winning the great war, we still somehow managed to lose everything. It is said our sultan has had constant nightmares over our failures. Only when our foes have been brought to heel again, can he have a peaceful sleep."

 TUR_intervene_in_the_economy_desc:0 "The Turkish Economy, though prosperous, is unstable. The market proved itself unbeneficial to the state, which leads to the only possible solution. I, the Sultan shall lead the economy of nobody else is competent enough"

 TUR_remilitarization_of_kostantiniyye_desc:0 "The Greeks have grown careless, thinking us a non-threat. We cannot and will not stand for this. A remilitarization of Konstantiniyye will force them to wake up and see us as more than just a corpse waiting to be kicked around." 

 TUR_pan_turkic_sentiment_desc:0 "Though most of the population is still tired from back to back wars, there are still many who desire to conquer. We will assign these men to government positions, especially on propaganda. We must rally our mens spirits if we wish to continue."

 TUR_sultan_kultu_desc:0 "The Sultan lies in bed one night, afraid that someone will take him. He hears footsteps and draws a gun from the desk next to him. He sees a shadow…and it's one of the guards doing a late night patrol. Does he know that for sure, is he not a spy making plans on his life? He gets out of bed, careful not to wake his wife. He takes his gun with him and gets to work, he has reforms to make."

 TUR_ministry_of_propaganda_desc:0 "The propaganda agents have done well so far, but not well enough. We will promote them to their own dedicated ministry as well as other agents to silence dissent. Any who try to spread lies or stir up trouble will soon be the ones awake in bed at night."

 TUR_convince_the_peeps_desc:0 "It worked, the people are beginning to understand what they need to do. Day after day, the ministry have been getting reports of those trying to spread dissent or taking down our propaganda. 'There are only 2 sources of truth, Allah and myself.' "

 TUR_purge_germans_in_gov_desc:0 "Those Germans talk a big game about "the greater good of our people" and "let the past stay in the past," NEVER. It is easy to think yourself invincible and all knowing in your great high castle. They do not know what is best for the Turks. Only a Turk can lead a Turk."

 TUR_descredit_the_opposition_desc:0 "It seems like people are not getting the message. Our agents will do all they can to "convince" the people to throw off their German brainwashing by any means necessary. 'Any heretics who do not see my vision will know nothing but pain.' "

 TUR_sultan_and_islamists_desc:0 "Though war exhaustion is common in our state, our faith has not faltered for a second. The sultan has numerous options to choose from, he needs only to find out which ones are the best of the best."

 TUR_islamist_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Though we have found the most reliable islamists, there are still a decent number of them willing to fight for our sultan's benefit. Perhaps putting them to work fighting for us would be a good use for them. After all, why waste a perfectly good fighting force of motivated men?"

 TUR_the_wolf_of_islam_desc:0 "We have shown the Greeks our teeth and taken the time to sharpen our claws. Tonight, the wolf of islam when rise, and it shall never be laid to rest."

 TUR_commit_to_pan_turkism_desc:0 "Though mostly known for occupying Anatolia, the Turkish people are so much more than that. There are Turks all over Asia that the other states are looking to integrate to their own cultures. As the only true Turkish state left, we must strike before it is too late for our brothers and sisters in exile."

 TUR_pan_turkists_of_the_new_generation_desc:0 "When a man is set in his ways, it is not easy to change their mind. The children however, that is a different story. The young mind is moldable like clay, perfect for building a generation of warriors. Though I may not live to see it, I can imagine it perfectly. An army of young men raised to swear vengeance against those who made us fall. I will be resting easy tonight with that on my mind."

 TUR_turkification_of_the_minorities_desc:0 "Even after being carved up, there are still minorities clamoring and attempting to rise up for their own states. It is clear the old way of doing things will not work anymore. We tried to be generous, but they have proven minorities to be unsustainable. They must either become a turk, or not be seen again."

 TUR_send_diplomats_to_russia_desc:0 "Though our historical enemies, Russia does have much to offer and we have similar ideas. If we can settle our differences, perhaps an alliance is not out of the question. Should this fail, well the Turks did originate in central Asia after all, may as well take this free excuse to grab our homeland."

 TUR_rostov_agreement_desc:0 "Contrary to what everyone thought, the Russians agreed. Our diplomats have returned from Rostov with joyful expressions, Our mutual interests have been recognized and differences settled. We did not need central Asia anyway, they are not even real turks anymore. With our northern border secured, we need only to make our move."

 TUR_war_with_persia_desc:0 "The enemies of Anatolia going back to the days of Rome, the Persians have always been a thorn to us. Their large size is not fooling anyone, they are weak and backwards. 1925 will be avenged and that map in my chambers will be replaced with something far better."

 TUR_pursue_an_alliance_with_russia_desc:0 "Seeing as our interests are sorted out, why not make this official? Even with the Germans putting significant funds into my state, they do not know what we truly want or what is best for us. Thank you for the money 'mein kaiser', we will use it to end you when our paths cross once again."

 TUR_promote_the_turks_of_syria_desc:0 "Those lines on a map mean nothing. There are plenty of Turks in Syria begging for a chance to join back with their families. Perhaps with a little bit of work, we can convince the Arabians to back down and let people come home to their families."

 TUR_latakia_or_war_desc:0 "Well would you look at that, the Turks are not happy in Syria. Who could have possibly seen this coming? Seems a little hypocritical of the Arabians to do the exact same thing they accused us of doing right. Perhaps their egos will convince them to give us back what is ours. If not, well we wanted them dead anyway."

 TUR_claim_izmir_desc:0 "The Greeks claim their homeland to be the cultural hub of Rome, but that is ridiculous, I am Caesar of Rome. Since Anatolia belongs to Rome, I should have them give back what belongs to me. With any luck, diplomacy is all we need to get back what is ours."

 TUR_push_for_kibris_and_the_aegean_desc:0 "Though not the first thought when someone talks about an empire, the Aegean Isles do serve a valuable purpose. They pose a direct threat against us as well as another front for us to deal with. Holding these islands is clearly a threat, one we should not take lightly. With Russia at our backs, our demands should carry enough weight to be taken seriously."

 TUR_liberate_eastern_thrace_desc:0 "With the mainland taken, it is time to relive 1453 and take back 'Constantinople.' The Greeks will be reminded every night for 1000 more years how badly they messed up trying to fight us. Now is the time to drive them back to the peninsula where they belong."

 TUR_revenge_for_the_first_balkan_war_desc:0 "Though most of our effort has been spent on the Greeks, they are only a small piece of the balkans. Once, eastern Europe was little more than our go to vacation spot. It was only in recent times that our subjects got some bright ideas. It is high time we remind them of their place, beneath their master's feet in Konstantiniyye."

 TUR_the_lone_wolf_desc:0 "To the surprise of absolutely noone, the Russians sent us home empty handed. Oh well, they cannot say we did not try. Now that we know what to expect, it is time to get to work."

 TUR_the_lands_which_were_stolen_desc:0 "Our state has been reformed, and our old friends are all in one place. The Balkans have always been an odd thing to Europe, and it is better for everyone if they stay that way. Let the powder keg be doused permanently."

 TUR_destruction_of_hellas_desc:0 "The first of our European holdings to break away from us, they have proven the most troublesome in recent times. Not only will we undo the megali idea, but topple them like the Byzantines they so desperately want to compare themselves to."

 TUR_oppressed_caucasians_desc:0 "With Russia rejecting our proposal, we are free to put our plans into place. The amount of states that could be formed out of Russia is immense with a solid chunk of them residing near our borders. By sending in our agents, we can spread discontent and nationalistic fervor."

 TUR_no_mercy_for_the_enemies_of_islam_desc:0 "With our prestige restored, we will make our new territories pay for abandoning us the first time. During every conflict since the start of the century, Muslims have been persecuted and deported all over the Balkans to make way for their own kind. What is it those christians say? 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' Not a bad idea, why do not we follow their lead and do unto them as they have done unto us?"

 TUR_strike_the_bear_desc:0 "Alright, I say we have made adequate preparations. The time has come for our strongest enemy to be brought down. Russia has spent the entire 19th century beating us down and taking our land. We only beat them in the Great War due to our German allies. With the Balkans under our control and the industry that comes with it, I can finally do what no Sultan or Caesar could. When I close my eyes for the final time, it will be one who rules all Turkish lands, including central asia."

 TUR_proclaim_the_turkish_empire_desc:0 "When I was young, my father told me the story of an old man looking out at the bosphorus. He was a man proud of all he had done, a man who history would call "the Magnificent," a man named Suleiman. As word reached me of our victories, I could not help feeling the same. I turned my head and saw Hagia Sophia, the other side of my great city. I sat down and pondered how his story ended. He was stopped at Vienna, and died mired in mistakes that came to haunt him and his empire. I wonder how my story will end. Will history see my conquests or the blood it took to get there? Will I be a man who restored an empire or a demon who oppressed millions?"


 TUR_focus_on_internal_matters_desc:0 "As much as we want to say we have plans to restore our empire, that would be silly. The fact of the matter is, we are too weak as we are to make any plans. Our time would best be spent focussing on the bottom line, the betterment of our state, not theirs."

 TUR_denounce_ottomanism_desc:0 "There are voices in our government who clamor for the return of the house of Osman to it’s former glory as an eastern hegemon. When I hear these comments, I wonder who is dealing them their Opium. Do these people not see what our situation is? We must do everything we can to discourage their behavior."

 TUR_our_place_in_the_new_world_desc:0 "The people won’t want to hear this, but we are not the Ottoman Empire, nor should we be. If we are to exert our influence, we will have to do it subtly."

 TUR_limited_isolationism_desc:0 "Only when we stopped looking outwards is when we knew peace. We must maintain some form of isolationism to keep our neighbors looking the other way from our activities."

 TUR_create_the_sultans_cabinet_desc:0 "Though not a traditional Osman, our sultan will do what he can to guide us through this uncertain time. We must create a cabinet for him to avoid the pitfalls of sultan's past that got us in this mess to begin with."

 TUR_exploit_the_bidding_war_desc:0 "Even if we were to do nothing, the great powers are dumping huge amounts into building us up in order to spite the other. Perhaps by planting some half-true intelligence we can exploit them into giving us more than they planned." 

 TUR_promote_a_europeanized_parliament_desc:0 "We must make a parliament similar to Europes to show the great powers that their investments are in fact bearing fruit. So long as the cash keeps flowing, we’ll continue to “show them” great results."

 TUR_appeal_to_italy_desc:0 "Though our enemies at one point, we have much we can learn from the Italians. They have been doing the policy of economically focussed isolationism for longer than we have and likely have some notes we can take. Perhaps some trade rights in the black sea can convince them to talk."

 TUR_dodecanese_for_industry_desc:0 "Though seemingly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, those islands are highly valuable culturally and Militarily. Recent investments from outside have left us with a healthy surplus of cash for the first time in a long while. Perhaps the Greeks would be eager to get a slice of it for a few meager islands."

 TUR_middle_east_situation_desc:0 "The middle east has always been rife with tension, but we were always there to calm them back down. However now, the tensions are no longer directed towards us. Like our enemies before us, we are in prime position to take advantage of this chaos."

 TUR_take_advantage_of_arabian_minorities_desc:0 "Contrary to its name, the “United States of Arabia” is not very united. We know exactly what minorities lie where, and what they want. Without the need of maintaining an empire, we are free to destabilize the region to our benefit."

 TUR_encourage_syrian_nationalism_desc:0 "What better way to weaken Arabia than to start with our southern neighbors. This will be the safest option is it is the closest to us, thus allowing the lowest risk. We have many nationalist organizations on record from the old ottoman archives. I say it is time we dust them off and see who is still willing to fight."

 TUR_anti_arabian_propaganda_desc:0 "Though our old contacts have bore fruit, it isn’t enough for the revolution we plan to host. We will create and distribute anti-arabian propaganda in order to bolster these secret societies."

 TUR_kickstart_the_syrian_revolution_desc:0 "All the pieces have been put into place, the rebel numbers have been bolstered and their men equipped. The only thing that needs to be done is light the spark." 
 TUR_monopolize_syrian_oil_desc:0 "As scientists have recently discovered, Syria is rich with the black gold. Seeing as we already have influence due to kickstarting the revolution, we are in prime position to demand concessions. These oil sales will fill our treasury to its capacity in no time."

 TUR_place_a_puppet_sultan_desc:0 "While we built up the revolutionary forces, of course we heavily focussed on those most likely to be loyal to us. If one of them just so happened to take power when the dust settled, well they were a war hero after all. It’s not our fault other factions couldn’t keep up."

 TUR_promote_a_turkish_northern_cyprus_desc:0 "Though the population of Cyprus celebrated the British invasion in 1914, those sides were quickly put to silence after our victory. Even after the Greeks took over in 1925, there are still many Turkish loyalists left over. By contacting them, they can help spread propaganda celebrating the Turks as much better rulers than the Greeks."

 TUR_arm_our_cooperators_desc:0 "As seems to be common in recent years, the Turks in Greece have not had a good time. Their treatment has been poor, and any weapons they had seized. It is up to us to supply them in order for them to fight for their freedom."

 TUR_erase_involvement_marks_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, it seems the Greeks had contingencies in place in case we tried anything. Their diplomats are already demanding answers for our activities. It will not be easy to convince them it wasn’t us, but it is necessary to not anger them to war."

 TUR_start_cypriot_civil_war_desc:0 "It was no easy feat, but we at least have the Greek diplomats either believing we aren’t involved or that they don’t have the evidence to prove anything. All that’s left to do is light the spark and get most of our agents out of Cyprus as fast as possible. If the Greeks figure out we did it, it will definitely lead to war. Here goes nothing."

 TUR_turkish_cyprus_desc:0 "With Cyprus holding out, a new government has been put in place. Of course, the cabinet has been stacked with Turkish agents ready to pounce. All we need to do is wait, and our Sultan will receive their request for integration."

 TUR_status_quo_desc:0 "One of our cabinet members entered work this morning laughing insanely hard. He was waving a Greek newspaper denouncing claims of our involvement in Cyprus as conspiracy theories. Naturally, we will be more than happy to reciprocate this as the truth. With no damning evidence, the international community will have choice but to maintain the status quo."

 TUR_the_looming_war_desc:0 "Anyone with a brain could tell you that all is not well in the world. Despite the scars of the Great War being fresh, the great powers are once again preparing to slaughter each other again. As much as we don't want to, it is likely we will be dragged in and must prepare accordingly."

 TUR_anti_russian_propaganda_desc:0 "Though the Arabs and Persians may not like it, none of us can stand up to a great power alone. We must convince our neighbors to let bygones be bygones and let them know that if one of us falls, we all will."

 TUR_prepare_for_sgw_desc:0 "Though we have stayed neutral up to now, the diplomats are demanding to know where we stand on various matters. We cannot stay silent on the matter forever. Luckily for us, everyone knows everyone else wants us, and are willing to pay a high price for our loyalty. We must choose carefully which side to support, the fate of the world may depend on it."
