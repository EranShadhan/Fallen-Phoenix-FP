 TUR_start_of_a_new_decade_desc:0 “The 20s was a rough time to be a Turk. All of our issues came crashing down at once. But that is in the past. With the great power set to tear eachother apart once again, we may just have a chance to bounce back.”
 TUR_constitution_of_1930_desc:0 “If we are to modernize, we must start with the inside. Constitutional reforms will be the perfect and only start to a new and modern Turkic state.” 
 TUR_reconvene_the_enguru_parliamen_desc:0 “With the constitution now in place, the current regime has to change. Perhaps the old parliament was treated too harshly by the public. Hopefully with recent events, they will stick around much longer this time.” 
 TUR_the_triumph_of_the_peoples_party_desc:0 Despite some initial protest, the people have spoken. The constitution is here to stay. There is nothing left to do but get to work. The people have given us their blessing and we cannot let them down.”
 TUR_education_modernization_desc:0 “The first step to fixing the state is working on the people. One way to ensure long term stability is to re educate the youth. By modernizing our education system, the problems of the past will never happen again as the brightest minds will one day gather in Konstantiniyye.”
 TUR_close_sufi_orders_desc:0 “One of our boldest steps, the Sufi Orders have to go. Widespread practice has slowed our growth to a crawl. The hardline islamists will hate this, but you cannot practice your belief if your country is conquered.”
 TUR_reform_the_penal_code_desc:0 “As time marched on, our penal code is stuck in the past, leading to overcrowded prisons with no chance of anyone returning to society. By reforming our code, we can hope that one day the prisoners can be reformed and serve the country once again.”
 TUR_abolish_traditional_headgear_desc:0 “So long as our old symbols remain, we will be held back from true greatness. Ending their use will be nothing short of a tedious nightmare, but it will be worth it in the long run.”
 TUR_promote_turkish_women_desc:0 “For far too long, the women in our society have been repressed even by European standards. A solid half of the population has been left to rot in their homes. Think of the potential being wasted. By granting them some power, we can raise our overall potential to greater heights.”
 TUR_new_civil_code_desc:0 “Some of our civil laws date back to the time of Byzantium. Some for good reason, but most of it is outdated. By westernizing our civil code, we can modernize our society to an acceptable standard.”
 TUR_latinization_of_the_turkish_alphabet_desc:0 “Though some may say it's unnecessary we must keep up the process of westernizing our country, including the alphabet. We will hold ourselves to their standard.”
 TUR_abolish_traditionalism_desc:0 “We are so close, foreign visitors have noticed our changes and praised them back home. All that is left to do is throw our traditions into the trash and embrace modernity. Then and only then, can we take our rightful place as a great power once again.”"
 TUR_monarchy_compromise_desc:0 “Although the Sultan has failed us, he is still a popular figure. Getting rid of him would cause more problems than it would solve. Perhaps granting the monarchists some concessions could silence the opposition.”
 TUR_the_sultans_abdication_desc:0 “Monarchism is a thing of the past. It was the Sultan who made us the sick man, It was the Sultan who lost us everything, and it will be the Sultan who falls with the old order.”
 TUR_a_true_democracy_desc:0 “As I look at Konstantiniyye, I no longer see a city stuck in the past. I see a modern marvel that even the likes of Berlin and London would be impressed by. The work has been long and hard, perhaps it is time for a hunting trip.”
 TUR_ataturk_dies_desc:0 “Extra Extra, Prishtina gunned down by Albanian Assassins, read all about it.” Those words were heard all around the world. As the news spread, members of the left and the right, both discontent with the reforms, have made their move. As chaos rains, what happens next is anyone's guess.”
 TUR_snap_election_desc:0 “As chaos reigns over Anatolia, a snap election seems to be the only way to return things to some normalcy. For good or for evil, here goes nothing.”

 TUR_commies_elected_desc:0 “Our greatest fears have been realized, Turkey has gone red. Alas, there is nothing we can do short of a civil war. All we can do now is watch what they do, and if their radical ideas can last.”
 TUR_promote_trade_unions_desc:0 “Despite taking power, the people are still oppressed by the old regimes holdouts. By promoting them, they too can rise and break free of their chains.”
 TUR_collectivization_of_agriculture_desc:0 “Even after all this time, the war has left our food supply scarce at best. We must follow the Japanese example and collectivize our food so no man will go without dinner tonight.”
 TUR_the_spirit_of_the_workers_desc:0 “The resistance has been ruthless, but we will not yield. The working man must remember what he fights for, and the oppression he once served under. It is not through gods and kings that we will prosper, but the indomitable spirit of the worker.”
 TUR_deal_with_the_ultranationalists_desc:0 “Despite being the ones to cause this in the first place, the far right is not content with what has gone down. It is only a matter of time before they try this stunt again and must be silenced before that can happen.”
 TUR_deal_with_german_influence_desc:0 “The government in Berlin has been openly opposed and refuses to recognize our regime. Though they have much influence in our state, we must kick them out before they can sponsor any unsavory characters.”
 TUR_the_islamic_bastion_of_socialism_desc:0 “With the workers freed, the Muslims among them have begun to spread propaganda of how Socialism is compatible with Islamic values. We must spread these as far and wide as possible to put more doubters to silence.”
 TUR_spreading_the_revolution_desc:0 “Though we have been freed, the rest of the middle east is still under oppression. We must build our strength and prepare accordingly so our brothers can also know what freedom is.”
 TUR_sponsor_syrian_rebellion_desc:0 “Our first stop in freeing the workers of the Middle East lies to our south. Though historical wounds run deep, we must show them this isn’t a new empire.” 
 TUR_alienate_enemies_desc:0 “Though seemingly alone, we command immense respect in the middle east even while weakened. Those who neighbor us and oppose our beliefs must be made to feel alone like the tyrants they are.”
 TUR_closer_ties_with_japan_desc:0 “Though seemingly alone in the world, we can at least count on the home of the revolution to hold firm. Japan will be our greatest comrades in the trials to come, we must strive to emulate their warrior spirit for the greater good of our brethren.”
 TUR_buy_japanese_guns_desc:0 “The middle east is big, we cannot possibly fund every movement off of Turkish factories alone. Luckily for us, our friends in Japan will be more than happy to supply us with their top of the line weapons.”
 TUR_arabic_revolution_desc:0 “With preparations complete, we must turn to our greatest trial yet, Arabia. Though seemingly stronger than us, we have taken appropriate measures to make sure we can combat their influence. We know from first hand experience, keeping all of Arabia together is no easy task.”
 TUR_red_crescent_coalition_desc:0  “Though Japan has served us well, they are too far away from us to fight alongside us when push comes to shove. We must form our own alliance more able to fight and defend ourselves from outside threats. A coalition. A coalition to protect and spread the ideas of Kadri and Marx. A coalition to preserve and embrace islamic values. A Coalition of a Red Crescent.”
 TUR_free_the_caucasian_workers_desc:0 “Caucasia has spent the last millenia being pushed around by its stronger neighbors. Well no more, it is time they secure their freedom. With this, we finally cleanse ourselves of our sins from the old empire by freeing our former subjects from all oppression.”
 TUR_support_persian_communism_desc:0 “Though not part of our old empire, the Persians are just as oppressed as everyone else. It is time we let bygones be bygones and put this millenia old rivalry to rest once and for all.”

 TUR_federalists_elected_desc:0 “It seems we had nothing to fear. The federalists have triumphed and the reforms will stick. We must pick up where Prishtina left off for the greater good of not just the Turks, but all of the Middle East.”
 TUR_promote_the_turkish_nation_desc:0 “Though beaten down, the recent times have shown we are not out. With the recent bidding war, we will take our place in the sun once again.”
 TUR_improve_relations_with_persia_desc:0 “Though our long time rivals, times have changed. Perhaps our shared enemy to our north could be enough of an olive branch to let bygones be bygones for both of our sakes.”
 TUR_appeal_to_the_arabians_desc:0 “With conflict on the horizon, our southern neighbor seems like a natural ally. It is only a matter of time until outside forces target them for their massive oil supply. By befriending them, perhaps the black gold can be used to defend us instead of our enemies.”
 TUR_create_konya_accords_desc:0 “Though we have been busy befriending our neighbors, most of it has been unofficial and unknown outside of the middle east. By making it official with an alliance, perhaps it will deter any aggression from those who see us as weak.”
 TUR_invite_egypt_desc:0 “As one who borders both French and German territory, we have no doubt Egypt would be happy to have allies against them. We must send our diplomats to them at once.”
 TUR_cooperate_with_germany_desc:0 “As our greatest trading partner, it is only natural we ally ourselves to the Kaiser. If a united Middle East wasn’t enough to scare off any opponents, this will absolutely do the trick.”
 TUR_free_caucasians_from_kerensky_desc:0 "The time has come, our strength has been built and an alliance secured. We are done hiding away from the Russians, we must bring them to heel since it is obvious they will never be content till we are dead.”
 TUR_representation_of_the_minorities_desc:0 “Though we have come far, we still face international scrutiny with our treatment of minorities. We must fix this at once before we can truly be called a modern state.”
 TUR_recognize_kurdish_citizenship_desc:0 “Outside of the Turks, the Kurds are the largest culture in our state. Granting them citizenship could help silence the constant calls for a Kurdish state.”
 TUR_the_islam_compromise_desc:0 “Our previous reforms have been criticized as too draconian against muslims. How can we say we are not oppressing others if we are oppressing our own citizens?”
 TUR_recognize_armenian_citizenship_desc:0 “In recent years, the Armenians have faced more repression and persecution than anyone else in the middle east. Though full reconciliation seems impossible, granting them citizenship would be a nice first step.”
