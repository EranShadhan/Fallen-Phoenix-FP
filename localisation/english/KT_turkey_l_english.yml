Much like the Bidding War, the Turks can benefit from such a competition, but once one of the sides gains enough support amongst the Turks, the Turkish Nation will be a secured ally. Will revanchism and irredentism spread in Turkey, driving it to the newformed Axis, or will it stay moderate and promote progressive values, siding with the Accord? Or will it go its own path, staying out of the global conflict. The future is uncertain."
