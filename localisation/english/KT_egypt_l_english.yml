 EGY_fragile_stability_desc:0 "After our independence from the British Empire, our nation has been cursed with constant unrest from our numerous minorities. The addition of the Levant has brought us more harm than good, with the current inhabitants being disloyal to our nation and seeking the creation of a Jewish state (the Jewish minority) or unification with the United Arab States (the Palestinian minority). Our problems don't stop there, as many Christians have threatened to leave the country, a great loss for us as they are one of the wealthiest groups in Egypt. We must find a way to appease everyone and show our minorities that if they stay loyal to Egypt, they will prosper and live happy lives."
