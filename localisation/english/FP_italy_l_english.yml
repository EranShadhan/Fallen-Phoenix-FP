 ITA_strengthen_ascari_corps_desc:0 "Our troops from the European parts of the Empire often struggle in the harsh climate of Africa. The natives, obviously, don't suffer from the same problems. We should hire some of them to support our troops when fighting in hot climates."
 ITA_comandante_diavolo:0 "Comandante Diavolo"
 ITA_comandante_diavolo_desc:0 "During our conquest of Eritrea and in our war in Ethiopia, we have often been bedeviled by the speed and tenacity of the native horsemen. Having struggled against them, we stand to gain much if we can get them to come over to our side, and an enterprising young officer might be able to become our very own 'Devil Commander'."

 ITA_a_bandits_war:0 "A Bandit's War"
 ITA_a_bandits_war_desc:0 "The old ways of waging war should have died in the trenches on the Isonzo. Some of our old generals still believe that modern war can be won by throwing masses of soldiers into the meatgrinder. We know better now: modern war is won by fast maneuvers and flexible organizations that can react quickly. We must prepare our army for this kind of war."
 ITA_carica_di_isbuscenskij:0 "Carica di Isbuscenskij"
 ITA_carica_di_isbuscenskij_desc:0 "Some say that the days of the horse and the rider on the battlefield are over. That the role of cavalry has been taken over by tanks and airplanes. But they are wrong - a horse does not need fuel, it does not need a groundcrew, it requires no spare parts except a new horseshoe every now and then. This gives cavalry a clear advantage even on the modern battlefield."
 ITA_army_leaders:0 "Army Leaders"
 ITA_army_leaders_desc:0 "Our armies must always be led by the most capable officers available. It is imperative that we create a steady flow of new and competent officers to maintain the advantage."

 ITA_italian_tankettes:1 "Italian Tankettes"
 ITA_italian_tankettes_desc:1 "While other countries might develop ever larger and ever heavier tanks in search of the super-tank that will render all other tanks obsolete, we know that the best tank is a tank that is actually on the field. A tank must be fast enough to go wherever it is needed in time, and it really only needs armor heavy enough to withstand rifles. Such a vehicle would be cheap and quick to produce."
 ITA_bersaglieri:0 "Bersaglieri"
 ITA_bersaglieri_desc:0 "The Bersaglieri, our elite light infantry, have long distinguished themselves in battle. While the future of warfare may be mechanized, the quality of the individual soldier will still be the decisive factor."
 ITA_divisioni_alpine:0 "Divisioni Alpine"
 ITA_divisioni_alpine_desc:0 "Our memory of the Great War will forever include the brutal fighting in the high alps. If we ever have to defend our country against a foreign invasion again, it will certainly come from the north, and require more fighting in inhospitable mountains. We must have soldiers capable of fighting effectively in that terrain."
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria:0 "Fanti dell'Aria"
 ITA_fanti_dell_aria_desc:0 "The bloody stalemate of the Isonzo Front during the Great War forced us into frontal assaults against a well-prepared enemy. The only way to accomplish a breakthrough was by crossing no-mans-land and taking the enemy trench. Modern planes can carry a group of soldiers quickly, far into the enemy's rear areas. Landing by parachute they can take strategic objectives to destabilize the enemy front-line."
 ITA_self_propelled_guns:0 "Self-Propelled Guns"
 ITA_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "The tank may have revolutionized warfare, but in many ways the self-propelled gun the is the most valuable vehicle on the battlefield. The fire support offered by comparatively cheap and simple vehicles is invaluable when it comes to fighting through fortifications or against enemy tanks."
 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly:0 "End Fiat-Ansaldo Duopoly"
 ITA_end_fiat_ansaldo_duopoly_desc:0 "Our mechanical and motorized engineering sector has long been dominated by two companies: Fiat and Ansaldo.

 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities:0 "Modernize Ansaldo Facilities"
 ITA_modernize_ansaldo_facilities_desc:0 "The economic downturn following the Great War plunged Ansaldo into such financial difficulties that they have largely been unable to properly modernize their factories. Only their elevated status has saved them from bankruptcy. If we wish for Ansaldo to remain such a core part of our mechanical engineering sector, we must ensure that they are using modern machines and techniques."
 ITA_ferrea_mole_ferreo_cuore:0 "Ferrea Mole Ferreo Cuore"
 ITA_ferrea_mole_ferreo_cuore_desc:0 "Our tank corps will undoubtedly be called upon to do great deeds of military daring. For this, it will not be enough to merely be driving around hulls of iron, they must also have Hearts of Iron."

 ITA_reggianes_exports:0 "Reggiane's Exports"
 ITA_reggianes_exports_desc:0 "The Reggiane company has developed a series of quite capable fighter planes that have caught the attention of foreign militaries seeking to modernize their airforce. If we should allow them to export their planes, the experience gained from modifying the base design to different specifications would no doubt be quite valuable for our own development projects."
 ITA_diving_bombers:0 "Diving Bombers"
 ITA_diving_bombers_desc:0 "The topic of Close Air Support has gained considerable importance in military circles. While planes have long been used to drop bombs, it appears that several countries have started to develop specialized planes that can place a bomb with unmatched accuracy by diving from high altitude. While our industry could no doubt produce such a plane in time, there are other countries that have designs for this very purpose."
 ITA_superaereo:0 "Superaereo"
 ITA_superaereo_desc:0 "The days of small groups of planes flying here and there are long gone. A modern air campaign is in many ways similar in complexity to any land-based undertaking. As such, we need a specialized planning staff to coordinate our various squadrons so they can act together to accomplish their missions."
 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role:0 "Officers of the Service Role"
 ITA_officers_of_the_service_role_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient to simply take officers from the army and teach them how to fly. Our airforce requires a new breed of officer, one that was raised and molded by the service instead of merely adopting it."
 ITA_standardization:0 "Standardization"
 ITA_standardization_desc:0 "The war in the air, more so than the war at sea and the war on land, is a war of industry against industry. Mass and mass alone is decisive. We must ensure that we can produce as many planes as possible, even if this means that it becomes more difficult to change designs later."
 ITA_specialization:0 "Specialization"
 ITA_specialization_desc:0 "Try as we might, we will never be able to match the bigger powers in terms of raw output. The only way we can compete in the air is by building better planes than anyone else. Each of them will have to be able to win a fight even when outnumbered three or four to one."
 ITA_multirole_aircraft:1 "Multi-Role Aircraft"

 ITA_intensify_torpedo_manufacturing_desc:0 "Italian torpedoes are among the most reliable in the world. Fiume was the birthplace of the torpedo, and with the factory there and the Silurificio Italiano plant at Naples, we have a good foundation on which to further expand our use of this deadly naval weapon."
 ITA_expand_naval_facilities:0 "Expand Naval Facilities"
 ITA_expand_naval_facilities_desc:0 "A first-class navy does not just need a strong battlefleet, but also the ports and dockyards to support it. By investing in our naval infrastructure, our navy will have the bases and the construction and repair capacity it needs when war breaks out."
 ITA_oto_naval_guns:0 "OTO Naval Guns"
 ITA_oto_naval_guns_desc:0 "Italy relies on the firms of Ansaldo and Oderi-Terni-Orlando for the big guns of its capital ships. By making targeted investments in their capacity, we can make our battleships the envy of the world."

 ITA_milizia_marittima_di_artiglieria:0 "Milizia Marittima di Artiglieria"
 ITA_milizia_marittima_di_artiglieria_desc:0 "Italy has an extensive coastline and isolated island ports, vulnerable to invasion. By reforming our Milizia Costiera and investing in our coastal defenses we can ensure any invaders pay a heavy price."
 ITA_supermarina:0 "Supermarina"
 ITA_supermarina_desc:0 "A modern operations center should be established for the Regia Marina’s Commander-in-Chief, to coordinate the operations of our naval formations throughout the Mediterranean and beyond."
 ITA_stockpile_fuel:0 "Stockpile Fuel"
 ITA_stockpile_fuel_desc:0 "Oil is the blood that runs in the veins of our ships, without which the fleet would be render inactive. With Italy lacking substantial domestic oil supplies, it is vital to build oil storage tanks and fill them, to sustain our forces even if future conflicts cut us off from imports."
 ITA_forza_navale_especiale:0 "Forza Navale Speciale"
 ITA_forza_navale_especiale_desc:0 "The capacity to make amphibious landings is likely to prove invaluable to any conflict in the Mediterranean. By setting up a Special Naval Force, trained and equipped for amphibious operations, we will be able to project power from the sea at any point of the long Mediterranean coastline."
 ITA_naval_air_coordination:0 "Naval-Air Coordination"
 ITA_naval_air_coordination_desc:0 "Up until now the air force high command has followed its own doctrine and not coordinated well with the navy. This has limited the Regia Marina’s capacity to undertake effective reconnaissance. By developing a joint naval-air doctrine and streamlining communications between naval and air units, our ships will be better able to find and strike the enemy."
 ITA_decima_flottiglia_mas:0 "Decima Flottiglia MAS"
 ITA_decima_flottiglia_mas_desc:0 "Teseo Tesei and Elios Toschi of the Genio Navale have designed a self-propelled torpedo that can be used to infiltrate enemy ports – by funding the development of this and other unique weapons, and training a special operations unit to use them, we may be able to achieve dramatic, unexpected victories over our enemies."
 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri:0 "Incrociatori Leggeri"
 ITA_incrociatori_leggeri_desc:0 "Fast and powerful enough to take on other light cruisers and sweep destroyers before them, but cheap enough to build in numbers, light cruisers are important in protecting our sea lanes, and in taking the fight to enemy convoys. By building on our experience with the Condottieri, Montecuccoli and Garibaldi classes, we can create a cruiser force to dominate the seas between Europe and Africa."
 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti:0 "Incrociatori Pesanti"
 ITA_incrociatori_pesanti_desc:0 "For now, Italy lacks the industrial base to build enough battleships for them to be everywhere we need them at once.

 ITA_expand_naval_intelligence:0 "Expand Naval Intelligence"
 ITA_expand_naval_intelligence_desc:0 "Italian signals intelligence has run on a small budget for many years, relying on the considerable talents of Giorgio Verità Poeta and Luigi Donini, but this will only go so far. By providing them with more staff, and enlisting new talents like Lieutenant Eliso Porto, we will stand a better chance of cracking enemies' codes and discovering the location of their forces."
 ITA_cooperation_programs:0 "Cooperation Programs"
 ITA_cooperation_programs_desc:0 "Our robust shipbuilding and armaments industry has a recent history of building warships for other nations, like Greece’s Hydra class destroyers, or assisting with design, such as that provided to the USSR for their Project 7 ships. Seeking out similar opportunities could help further develop our industrial base for the trials that lie ahead."
 ITA_cruiser_submarines:0 "Cruiser Submarines"
 ITA_cruiser_submarines_desc:0 "To attack the sea lanes of enemies that lie outside the Mediterranean, we need long-range submarines that can roam the oceans. Providing further support to our extensive post-WW1 submarine program, based largely on the work of engineers Cavallini and Bernardis, will help us achieve this goal."
 ITA_midget_submarines:0 "Midget Submarines"
 ITA_midget_submarines_desc:0 "The clear waters of the Mediterranean are dangerous for larger submarines. Building small, short-range, low-visibility boats can enhance their chances at surviving in a Mediterranean environment, and give us the force we need to patrol important choke-points like the Sicilian Channel."
