 german_customs_union_member:0 "Deutsche Wirtschaftszollunion Member"
 german_customs_union_member_desc:0 "The Deutsche Wirtschaftszollunion, or German Economic-Customs Union was formed among members in the German Sphere right after the Great War. It's aim was to have a shared customs union and a shared market. \n\nThis would help the poorer nations that Germany had just conquered the most, as they can sell their resources for a higher price. The Germans would benefit from this the most, however, as they would be getting cheap resources from the countries that they had just conquered. \n\nStill, a lot of countries in Europe, mostly former German allies in the Great War, saw an economic opportunity in joining this Customs Union and it was expanded again in 1921. \n\nThe German Customs Union has put an embargo on France, due to them becoming Fascist and eliminating the political opposition, as well as terrorizing it's own people. This has damaged France greatly, as they cannot trade for coal and steel, which are vital war resources. \n\nThe future of the German Customs Union is uncertain, as the main beneficiary is Germany, and with Eastern Europe starting to recover economically, some may wish to leave the Customs Union behind."
