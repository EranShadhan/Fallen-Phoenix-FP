ROM_pol_1_desc:0 "With our old enemy on the verge of collapse, we must take a deep look at ourselves so that when the time comes, we will be ready to pounce."
ROM_pol_2_desc:0 "Despite his controversial past, Carol II will be the best choice going forward. A constitutional monarchy will give us a perfect balance against the tyranny that seeks to oppose us."
ROM_pol_3_desc:0 "For us to prosper, the people must be durable like their home. Only by strengthening the common man, will we be able to embrace destiny. "
ROM_pol_5_desc:0 "The nation's path is clear and the ballots have been prepared. There is nothing left to do but wait for the people of Romania to decide our future. May god bless us. "
ROM_pol_k_1_desc:0 "Enough is enough. Anyone with eyes can clearly see that this election is a failure. Bribery and threats are rampant, and nothing about this election can be trusted. Carol II will do his God given job and set this straight by taking power for himself. "
ROM_pol_k_2_desc:0 "The current legal system doesn’t allow us to do what needs to be done. I say it is high time we change the rules around here. Our power must be absolute lest we all doom ourselves in our negligence. "
ROM_pol_k_3_desc:0 "For his majesty to set things straight, he requires funding. It is a pity the lower class will not understand the meaning of this, but hopefully someday they will understand what needs to be done."
ROM_pol_k_4_desc:0 "The people have grown rebellious, citing the constitution in saying “Carol has gone too far.” What utter rubbish. We must suspend this constitution and remind the people of their place."
ROM_pol_k_5_desc:0 "The stage has been set and all the pieces are in place. Once that crown touches his head, the future will begin in glory and splendor. Wait...What’s that in the audience?"
ROM_pol_kw_1_desc:0 "Rejoice! By the grace of God almighty, the king lives. His majesty took that bullet and got right back up to accept his crown with a head held high. Truly, a moment that will go down in history. "
ROM_pol_kw_2_desc:0 "We know who voted for what, we know who played what part in the incident. We must bring the traitors who did this to justice, and let every man woman and child know what happens to traitors."
ROM_pol_kw_3_desc:0 "With the chaos of the assassination attempt settling down, it is time to get to work. Carol has all the tools he needs to straighten things out, he merely needs to sign his will into law."
ROM_pol_kw_4_desc:0 "Despite being our stalwart allies, we must make clear to Bulgaria that we are equal partners and that Dobruja is ours. Though we wish it doesn’t escalate, we must show our commitment to our fellow man. "
ROM_pol_kw_5_desc:0 "With the tax money we raised, we have chosen the locations to use it. Hopefully this will show those we taxed that we are no selfish dictators, merely those with their best interest in mind. "
ROM_pol_kw_6_desc:0 "Our military is outdated and in desperate need of reform. Our new model will focus on defense and scavenging resources to best take advantage of our rough terrain and wear our enemies down for a counterattack. "
ROM_pol_kw_7_desc:0 "With the lands given to us via the Romania Hungarian war, we now have a small Hungarian minority in our lands looking for work. It would be a pity to lose such a valuable workforce to emmigration. We must put them to work for their new homeland. "
ROM_pol_kw_8_desc:0 "If you looked in the streets, you’d see people going about their business, happy to see each other. The people will see no disdain or difference from each other. As far as the people are concerned, they are all equal to one another. "
ROM_pol_kw_9_desc:0 "Thank God Carol survived that bullet, I can’t imagine a Romania without him. The streets are alive, the people are happy, and his reign will go down as a golden age. God bless his majesty, King Carol the Wise. "
ROM_pol_kw_10_desc:0 "The King has expressed his dream of a Neo-Dacian Empire and we shall make it happen, we will forge an incident where Romanian and Hungarian troops will fight in the city of Debrechen."
ROM_pol_kw_11_desc:0 "Today, the king held a speech in which he proclaimed the Neo-Dacian empire, as crazy and unnatural as that sounds, it was the truth and Romania was no longer a weak balkan nation, but one which deserves respect from the other European Powers"
ROM_pol_kw_12_desc:0 "Even tho it seems impossible, we could try to find some common ground with Bulgaria, we have sent a Delagate to Sofia to try to unite our 2 nations, we are waiting for him to come back."
ROM_pol_kw_13_desc:0 "Well, we were able to occupy sofia and now, nobody will stop us from creating this union, the Bulgaro-Romanian kingdom is now reality."

ROM_pol_rc_1_desc:0 "“Extra! Extra! his majesty Carol II passed away at 23:19 last night from a bullet wound. Read all about it.” Here’s to hoping the new regency can solve this crisis. "
ROM_pol_rc_2_desc:0 "Despite his reforms being unpopular, there are still those loyal to the late Carol II. We must wipe our hands clean of him and his followers before we can thrive. "
ROM_pol_rc_3_desc:0 "We know it was the Iron Guard who did the deed on Carol II. We must put a stop to them and their radical ideas before they kill our prince regent. "
ROM_pol_rc_4_desc:0 "With the board wiped of the previous opposition, we can use the freedom of not having a monarch on the throne to get a constitution going. However, it will have to be rushed due to an ever worsening political crisis. "
ROM_pol_rc_5_desc:0 "Now that the crisis has calmed down, we can actually take the time we need to iron out the flaws of the constitution."
ROM_pol_rc_6_desc:0 "As previously stated, not having a monarch on the throne means we are free to establish a parliament similar to the British model. Though hardline monarchists won’t approve of this, it is the exact thing we need to keep our nation stable and prosperous. "
ROM_pol_rc_7_desc:0 "What good is a parliament without a prime minister? Though everyone expected a fierce and drawn out debate, one candidate emerged as the overwhelming favorite: Iuliu Maniu. "
ROM_pol_rc_8_desc:0 "With the people skeptical about this new system, we must show them we mean them well. The parliament has agreed to use the money gained from Carol IIs tax increase to bolster Romania infrastructure and architecture."
ROM_pol_rc_9_desc:0 "With the lands given to us via the Romania Hungarian war, we now have a small Hungarian minority in our lands looking for work. It would be a pity to lose such a valuable workforce to emmigration. We must put them to work for their new homeland. "
ROM_pol_rc_10_desc:0 "Enough time has passed, Michael is ready to put on the throne. Though this time, we will make sure no bullets come his way. With a Parliament at his back, we have set the young Michael up for success."
ROM_pol_rc_11_desc:0 "Though our political issues have been solved, we are falling behind our competitors in industry. We must push forward at full speed to catch up before Hungary decides to take our territory back from us."
ROM_pol_rc_12_desc:0 "Despite being our stalwart allies, we must make clear to Bulgaria that we are equal partners and that Dobruja is ours. Though we wish it doesn’t escalate, we must show our commitment to our fellow man. "
ROM_pol_rc_13_desc:0 "Researchers have found vast quantities of the black gold under our soil. We must take immediate advantage of this before we can be exploited like the middle eastern states. "

ROM_army1_desc:0 "Though we remained neutral in both the Great War and the recent Turkish War, Romanians observing both conflicts saw tactics unrecognizable to us. Our current formations need to change if we are to stand a chance if and when the great powers start fighting again."
ROM_army2_desc:0 "Not only did the observers see new tactics, but the weapon designs "looked really new” whatever that means. Awkward phrasing aside, the point of this is clear. Our weapons are outdated and in desperate need of modernization if we hope to stand a chance against our neighbors."
ROM_army3_desc:0 "Though we could set aside money to purchase foreign equipment, even a child could tell you why that’s a bad idea long term. We must prepare our land to be used for production when we inevitably get cut off from our suppliers."

ROM_army_m_1_desc:0 "Though a Grape-Seller until recently, Malaxas business has immense potential. Officially, he is the top official in Romania on steam locomotives. However, why let him only do that when it is clear as day he can do so much more? Whether this means upscaling his business or diversifying it, only time will tell."
ROM_army_m_2_desc:0 "Developed in 1925, the Industria Aeronautica Romania was made in order to break our reliance on the Germans for our virgining air industry. However, it has been highly neglected since its creation and is little more than something to show off to foreign investors who don’t know better. We must invest into it to both keep up with our competition and to keep our investors satisfied."
ROM_army_m_3_desc:0 "Though 2 separate companies, the Resita Works are an invaluable part of our industry providing us with plenty of Iron and Steel. When push comes to shove, we will need all the metal we can get."
ROM_army_m_4_desc:0 "With the groundwork laid for something great, we need to proceed carefully. Anyone can throw money at a business and tell it to move, but supplies are limited. Fortunately, we have drawn up a plan on the best way to use our limited supplies to best defend ourselves and our interests."
ROM_army_m_5_desc:0 "Like predicted, the investors are wanting to see results. We can show them what we currently have for now, but in the future they will want to see the top of the line. By investing further into this, we can not just keep up with the competition, but surpass them and make the newest model of warplane."
ROM_army_m_6_desc:0 "The train is a crucial part of warfare and should be invested into. But it is a mass of steel at the end of the day. Surely it can do more than just transport things right? I mean, it seems like such a waste to put all that effort into just steel that moves."
ROM_army_m_7_desc:0 "Results have been promising so far, but there is more, we can tell. Further investments will be required in order to draw out this company's full potential. Lord knows we will need it."

ROM_army_p_2_desc:0 "Romania is smaller than all of its neighbors, and our population count shows. We can invest into better artillery to keep our young men safe behind a storm of exploding shells."
ROM_army_p_3_desc:0 "In the event our young men come to blows with our enemy, they need nothing but the finest weapons we can muster to keep them safe and able to fight another day."
ROM_army_p_4_desc:0 "It doesn’t matter how strong our army is if our enemy has the speed to outflank and surround us every time. Investing into light war machines will help us solve this problem while providing a not too shabby defense."
ROM_army_p_6_desc:0 "Our new models can help in a one on one encounter, but not every battle will be a quickdraw inside a building. Our new sub-machine gun model will be just the tool should someone find themselves outnumbered."
ROM_army_p_7_desc:0 "We have the solution, light tanks. They are fast enough to outflank the heavier models of richer nations, bulky enough to protect our young men, and powerful enough to destroy their young men. We must mass produce these as soon as possible."

ROM_pol_d_1_desc:0 "Though monarchy seems to be the dominant path in Europe, the people are beginning to think otherwise. Monarchs have come and gone, but our problems haven’t. We must look towards to prosperity of the distant United States for ideas."
ROM_pol_d_2_desc:0 "Though the masses are pleased, the old nobility has every reason not to be. No amount of money will convince them to leave; more drastic action is needed. This may seem undemocratic, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
ROM_pol_d_3_desc:0 "With the democracy experiment working so far, some supporters of the old regime in France have decided to flee to Romania to provide their advice and service. We must show them that their gamble will pay off."
ROM_pol_d_4_desc:0 "Despite doubts from our neighbors, we have proven that democracy can work. We have made the Hungarians to feel right at home without resorting to terror tactics. With every man being equal, Romania can truly begin to prosper."
ROM_pol_d_5_desc:0 "With the new French arrivals, their lessons and stories have given us ideas. One thing we haven’t done is elect a president. Fortunately, we have several candidates ready to take up the mantle."
ROM_pol_d_6_desc:0 "With our territorial gains against Hungary, we now have numerous Hungarians living in our borders. An old fashioned monarchy would maybe have kicked them out or force them to be Romanian. But this is a new Romania, one that strives to bring freedoms and prosperity for all. The only change is that there will be a Hungarian community in Romania."
ROM_pol_d_7_desc:0 "The king has been asked to come by 2 men with an intresting offer for Romania's future, and the king will be needed to clear the dispute between them, bewteen pushin for a civilian economy, or to get ready for the next war"
ROM_pol_d_8_desc:0 "Though our regime is stable so far, there are still doubters who question if a democratic Balkans is possible. We must show them that not only can democracy work, but it can prosper far more than authoritarianism."
ROM_pol_d_9_desc:0 "With a new bastion of democracy established, it is time we spread democracy to our neighbors. No better start than our old ally Bulgaria. With our positive recent history, it won’t be too hard to slip agents into the nation to spread democratic ideas."
ROM_pol_d_10_desc:0 "At last, the fruits of our democracy are in bloom. Our economy has grown exponentially since we transitioned. With this prosperity in hand, our mission will only get easier from here."
ROM_pol_d_11_desc:0 "Romania has a decent supply of gold that is just gathering dust. As storm clouds gather, we will dust our gold off and use them to bolster our productions. Hopefully this heavy investment will prove enough to match our stronger neighbors."
ROM_pol_d_12_desc:0 "Though our economy is better than ever, our industry is lacking. We must upgrade our industry to defend our new freedoms by any means necessary."
ROM_pol_d_13_desc:0 "Though we wish it wouldn’t, it is likely conflict will soon come to us. We must motivate our men to fight for their freedoms with some old Romanian folk lore and war songs. With any luck, this will encourage them to fight ever harder to be home by Christmas."
ROM_pol_d_15_desc:0 "Though they are a tyranny, we have quite an interest in boosting them up. If the 2 factions can destroy each other, that should mean their interference in the Balkans will dwindle to nothing. While we have no intentions of joining the war on their side, bringing the Germans down a peg could do us well."
ROM_pol_d_14_desc:0 "Though a threat to us, better to have a friendly threat than a tyrannical France. Perhaps a German victory could restore some kind of democratic system in France, we certainly hope so."
ROM_pol_d_16_desc:0 "Enough time has passed, our agents are in Bulgaria and have been there long enough to throw off any suspicion. We must put our plan into motion. We will slowly build a democratic government that will throw off the old regime. When the time comes to rise, we will be there to support our democratic Balkan bretheren."
ROM_pol_d_17_desc:0 "With more and more people coming to Romania, we will open a new university in Bucharest to foster the next generation. With this, a good chunk of our funding meant to prepare for war can be written off to any skeptics as bolstering our education."
ROM_pol_d_18_desc:0 "Even with enough to sell the Germany and France, we still have a considerable amount of our assets to our name. With a conflict sure to come over Bulgaria, why not put them to use in boosting our military strength?"
ROM_pol_d_19_desc:0 "As the alarm is about to be sounded, we will approach those who have pledged to fight with Romanian weapons. The Bulgarian officials have begun cracking down on sympathizers, but few realize it is us behind it. If we’re not careful, they could realized what were up to and stop up before we even start."
ROM_pol_d_20_desc:0 "We’re getting close, I can feel it. We must take advantage of every moment and resource we have left before the conflict begins."
ROM_pol_d_21_desc:0 "The moment has come. Our sympathizers are waiting and growing anxious. Small pockets of fighting have already broken out, we can’t wait another moment. ONWARDS TO SOFIA."
ROM_pol_d_23_desc:0 "With our territorial gains in the Balkans, we now have numerous Minorities living in our borders. But we have done this all before. When the dust settles, the Balkans will be at peace."
ROM_pol_d_24_desc:0 "From Sofia to Belgrade, From Tirana to Zagreb the people of the Balkans have finally been united, and we now stand as a beast in the region, ready to challenge anyone who tries to conquer it"
