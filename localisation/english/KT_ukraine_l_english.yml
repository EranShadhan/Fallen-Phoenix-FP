The Habsburg tradition and Ukrainian nationalism are represented by his devotion to the independence of Ukraine and his leadership during the stormy times. Assuming that legacy places Ukraine into the advocates of the historical monarchies in Europe. Their vision of the Embroidered One lubricates the strength of the Habsburg rule, consolidates the stability of of our State, augments our political might, and helps to discipline and fortify our army with other glorious attributes of the past."
