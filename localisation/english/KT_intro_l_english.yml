 NEW_DECDADE_NAME:0 "A New Decade"
 NEW_DECDADE_DESC:0 "It is the year 1930, 14 years after the Great War. as this war ended in a german victory something something to be changed later"
 FRA_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "After the Germans captured Paris in late 1914, the French were determined to take the city back. The problem was that due to inadequate uniforms and poor tactics, this was never achieved. Morale of the French army plummeted and in 1916 France surrendered, ending the Great war. \n\nIn the Interwar period, the French were led by the Republican Front, who was blamed for the loss of the war and paved the way for more extremist political parties to rise to power. In 1921 the French had to fight an insurgency in Algeria, which was called by the Ottoman Empire when they called for a jihad and for the Muslims to liberate themselves from the Europeans. \n\nThis insurgency was followed with Morocco declaring independence and France working with them in order to pacify the Algerian rebels. Politically, France entered a stalemate, as no political ideology had the support required to form a stable government. \n\nIn 1926 the Republican front collapsed and formally seized to exist. The parties left were the fascist French Revival, socialist Popular Front, and neutral Independent Radicals. The Independent Radicals have had enough and held a vote among themselves regarding which political party they want to join, only for the sake of getting France a stable government. \n\nAfter an intense vote, the French Revival won with 56.8% of the votes. This put the fascists in charge, who are now in the process of turning the country into a dictatorship and taking revenge on Germany."
 UKR_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "Ukraine was liberated after the conclusion of the Great war. While Archduke Wilhelm of Austria, member of the House of Habsburg became ruler of the nation, the country would be in the German sphere of influence more than the Austrian one. \n\nAn interesting fact is that Archduke Wilhelm of Austria changed his name to Vasyl Vyshyvanyi and would become an Ukrainian nationalist. He was even writing poertry in Ukrainian and fully adopted the Ukrainian identity. \n\nHis number one goal would be to reclaim all of Ukraine, which is mostly occupied by Russia, but his beloved Austria holds Ukrainian-majority areas in Galicia. \n\nThe main problem in Ukraine was that it's territory was the battlefied during the Great war, so the Ukrainians are by far the poorest in the German Sphere. There needs to be investments in Ukraine, so the country can kickstart it's economy and rival Russia."
 IRE_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "Ireland has been a core state of the British Empire for Centuries. Ever since 1542 the green island and it’s people has been seen as second class citizens of the crown. Over the curse of history the brave Irishmen have fought for their liberation from the oppressing English dominated union. The Irish war of independence has left the people of Ireland with mixed emotions. Ireland had managed to gain autonomy and the status of a dominion but it failed to give the people a free Irish state with many of them turning to more radical options for the price of freedom.\n\nA significant portion of the people have turned to the far left and far right political spectrum with the Blueshirts and the Peoples Party of Ireland gaining more and more power each day, worrying the centrists of the country.\n\nThe Blueshirts is the main ultranationalist movement in Ireland with their chairman Eoin O'Duffy being the ex leader of the Monaghan army of the Irish Republican Army that seeks Irish independence and is hostile to the current government and Governor General of Winston Churchill.\n\nThe People’s Party of Ireland is the biggest communist side of Ireland with their leader, an ex trade union leader, being none other than James Larking. They too desire independence and are hostile to the government but also desire a communist utopia in Ireland.\n\nMany types of radicals dream of a free Ireland but many of centrists too desire independence. Such men are Michael Colling and Eamon de Valera. Although willing to cooperate with London the Social Democrat Colling and the Social Conservative Vera do not hide the fact that they want full independence from Britain but still seeking close and friendly relations between the two countries."
 PER_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "Being neutral in the Great war, Persia still was largely affected mostly because of the British decline of power and having no trading partner. In 1925 the Persians have joined in with the Salonika Pact against th Ottoman Empire and were the main German proxy. After the war Persia found it's new tarding partner and a strategic ally, the German Empire."
 POR_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "Portugal joined the side of the Entente during the Great war. Thankfully for them, they joined the losing side just before France surrendered, so the Portuguese were not punished in any way after the war. This was a friendship gesture by the Germans. \n\nPortugal was a Republic, but they rebelled and replaced the Republic with a Monarchy. Since the House of Braganza was pro-British and Manuel II had fled to Britain after the 1910 revolution, the House of Braganza couldn't continue their rule over Portugal. \n\nAs to not completely abandon the House of Braganza, there was a compromise. Infanta Maria Ana of Portugal was a member of the House of Braganza and she married George, King of Saxony - a member of the German Royal House of Wettin. Since Portugal was pro-German and anti-British, they would accept their son - Prince Johann Georg of Saxony, as a ruler of Portugal. \n\nIn doing so, Portugal would join the German Customs Union and be firmly in the German Sphere of Influence."
 ITA_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "During the Great war, Italy was initially neutral, but the situation quickly changed with Germany capturing Paris in late 1914. At that point, the Italians were in favor of joining the Central Powers, who would grant Italy some free land. \n\nThis is because the Italians predicted that the Central Powers were going to win the war either way, so Italy could enter their side and gain something from it. The Italians got Nice, Savoy, Corsica, Tunisa, and Malta, after the Great war. \n\nThen the Italian foreign policy became one of neutrality and perceiving their gains in the Great war. The Italians are ruled by Italy First party, whose's goal is to catch up economically to Austria and Germany. \n\nThe Italians didn't take place in the Wars of the Ottoman Collapse because there was nothing to gain, and everything to lose, mainly the newly-conquered territories. Adding more hostile territories would not benefit Italy. With rising tensions in Europe and France swinging to the fascist side, the Italians need to choose with whom to side in the upcoming Great war continuation."
 GER_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Germans did a great gamble in the Great war, which resulted in their victory. The idea was to lose East Prussia to Russia, which would shorten the frontline with the Russians, taking fewer soldiers to hold. Then, the Germans would strike France and with some luck, capture Paris in late 1914. \n\nThe French tried to retake the city multiple times, but when this proved unsuccessful, the war ended with a German victory. This allowed for Germany to reshape Eastern Europe, creating friendly goverments in the United Baltic Duchy, which were briefly invaded by Russia in 1921, Finland, Poland, Ukraine, and Belgium. \n\nAs to benefit economically from these countries, the Germans created the 'German Customs Union' which includes these countries + the former Central Powers. In this economic union, the Germans can profit from having a shared market with poorer countries, as this allowes for Germany to get cheap grain and steel. \n\nDuring the Wars of the Ottoman Collapse, Germany couldn't save their former ally of the Ottoman Empire, but they found a clever workaround so they can still get their cheap oil, this time from Persia. The Germans mediated the peace in the Middle East and prevented Russia from taking Constantinople, which was granted to Greece and the Salonika Pact, with whom Germany has good relations. \n\nThe Germans also have great relations with the rest of the former Ottoman Empire, as they promised to protect the United Arab States. Germany and Russia also entered in an unofficial bidding war for the Turkish Sultanate, as to secure them as an ally. Germany was eventually victorious there."
 BUL_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Bulgarian State saw an opportunity in the Great war where they could join Germany's side after the capture of Paris. This would allow Bulgaria to take their desired Serbian lands of Macedonia, and even expand into Nish. \n\nThe Bulgarians and the Greeks were surrounded by the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with Russia and Italy also not being so far away. This is why these Balkan countries, including Albania, decided to put their differences asside and formally united, signing the Salonika Pact. The main idea was to stay united and prevent any foreign power from expanding into the Balkans. \n\nIn fact, the Salonika Pact was the one to initiate the Wars of Ottoman Collapse, as a response to the Ottoman Policies of ethnic cleansing, maily against Greeks, but also some Bulgarians. \n\nIn that war, Bulgaria didn't gain a lot of land, as they only got the cities of Odrin, Lozengrad, and Lüleburgaz, but also Bulgaria had to cede Debar province to Albania, as to compensate them for being involved in this war. Since Bulgaria didn't gain a lot, but Greece gained Constantinople and the Aegean Anatolian Coast, Bulgaria and Albania were promised lands in Serbia-Montenegro, if something were to happen to Austria-Hungary and Illyria."
 TUR_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Turkish Sultanate, which prior to that was the mighty Ottoman Empire. They joined the Great war and enjoyed success mostly against Russia, where they were able to seize the entire Caucasus after the war, in addition to all British possesions on the Arabian Peninsula. \n\nThis victory gave the Ottomans confidence that they should embrace their traditional Muslim values and not reform and industralize like the rest of Europe. This wasn't a big deal initially, but it quickly affected most of Europe, as the Ottoman Empire declared Jihad and called for all Muslims to rise in North Africa and Central Asia, as to liberate themselves France, Britain, and Russia. \n\nThis was very successful and eventually Morocoo broke free from France, with Pakistan and Egypt breaking away from the British Empire. The Muslims in Central Asia were crushed by Russia, however. \n\nThen, the Ottoman Empire pursued a policy of ethnic cleansing against it's minorities, which directly angered Greece and Bulgaria, who were the first to declare war upon the Ottomans. Russia and Persia soon joined the war against the Ottoman Empire, which also allowed for the Arabs to rebel against them, sealing the deal for the Ottoman Empire. After it's defeat, in 1926, Ahmet Tevfik who was in opposition to the young turks and the three pashas would launch a coup against the Ottoman empire. \n\nAfter the coup the House of Osman would be exiled to Egypt and the Ottoman empire would be abolished, replaced by the Turkish Sultanate under the rule of Ahmet and the newly created house of Tevfik.\n\n due to a bidding war between Russia and Germany, it quickly recovered economically. But, the Turkish Sultanate is a shadow of it's former glory."
 ENG_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The British Empire joined the Great war, but their allies of France and Russia were quick to surrender 2 years into the conflict. This left the British in an awkward position, where they weren't punished too badly. Germany only directly annexed Kenya and Uganda, so Britain will not hold a grudge against the Germans. As for the rest of the British Empire, they lost Gibraltar to Spain, which was granted to the Spaniards for free, Malta to Italy, and Cyprus to Greece. \n\nAfter the war, Ireland rebelled in 1916, but their rebellion was poorly organized and was crushed. Still 2 years later the South Africans rebelled, as the British Empire could not reach them, making South Africa win the conflict easily and secure their independence. Then, the Irish also rebelled and were granted partial autonomy, as they are now a Dominion of the Empire. \n\nIt all went downhill in 1921 when the Ottoman Empire called for a Jihad against the former Entente of France, Russia, and Britain. The the Brits lost Pakistan, as the Pakistanis made up the majority of the Army in the British Raj. Most importantly the Egyptians rebelled, and since Britain lacked Gibraltar and Malta, they could not reach Egypt. The Brits also lost their land connection to Egypt in Africa, so their only hope to secure the Suez Canal was via a naval invasion. This ambitions project was carried out as British Commonwealth troops were sent to British Somaliland, and then they landed in Egypt, securing the Canal in a peace treaty. \n\nPolitically, Britain was not doing so well, as they lacked any political majority to form a stable cabinet. Eventually, with the downfall of the Concervative party and the Liberals not being as popular, the social-democrat Labour party took over British Politics. The country doesn't hold a grudge against Germany, as they only directly took two colonies in Africa, but Britain seeks to restore their Empire in any way possible."
 GRE_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Greece remained neutral in the Great war, as it took them years to decide which side to join, due to the split between the Prime Minister and the King, who favored different sides. A decision was never made, but the war already ended with a German victory. The Germans granted Greece all of Cyprus as a reward for their neutrallity, which made the King more popular in Greece. \n\nThe Bulgarians and the Greeks were surrounded by the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with Russia and Italy also not being so far away. This is why these Balkan countries, including Albania, decided to put their differences asside and formally united, signing the Salonika Pact. The main idea was to stay united and prevent any foreign power from expanding into the Balkans. \n\nIn that war, Greece gained Constantinople and the Aegean Anatolian Coast, but they also did a population exchange with the Turkish Sultanate, so Greeks from Pontus were safely relocated to the Kingdom of Greece, while Turks in Thrace and Macedonia were relocated to the Turkish Sultanate. \n\nAs Greece was the main beneficiary in this war, they promised their allies control over Serbia-Montenegro if the Salonika Pact would end up fighting the Habsburgs, of if their empire were to disintegrate."
 SOV_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire was initially successfull in the Great war, but once Germany captured Paris, they sent the bulk of their army on the Eastern Front, destroyign the Russians and resulting in a humiliating peace treaty for them. There, Russia lost parts of Ukraine, all of Poland, the United Baltic Duchy, and Finland, to Germany. Russia also lost all of the Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire. \n\nAlexander Kerensky became the leader of the Provisional Government, but he was dealing with protests all the time. This is why the high-command decided to invade the United Baltic Duchy, with the goal to distract the public. The Russians would conscript future protestors and send them intentionally to their deaths against the United Baltic Duchy and Germany. \n\nThe communists in Russia still enjoy some support, but they cannot win in a civil war in this state of Russia. They are waiting for another massive war to start, just so they can rise up then and turn the whole world communist. This communist thread is very present in Russian politics. \n\nThere was an opportunity for the Provisional Govenrment to gain more support, as the Salonika Pact declared war on the Ottoman Empire, where Russia joined with the goal to reclaim the Caucasus and Ottoman Armenia. They were overall successful, but they failed to reach the Baku oil fields, which were occupied by Persia, with the help of geographic proximity and German support. \n\nRussia was able to stabilize and when their ally of France became a fascist state, the Russians started to incorporate elements of this into their own government. \n\nRight now the goal of Russia is to declare war on the German Empire and restore their former glory, if not, to reach new hights and take even more."
 UBD_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The United Baltic Duchy were created after the conclusion of the Great war as an integrated German politcal and economic puppet state. Right after their creation, the Russian Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky would declare war on them, with the aim to either secure a military victory, or to send it's soldiers to their doom, with the aim to have less future protestors. With the aid of Germany, the United Baltic Duchy came out on top and secured their independence. \n\nStill, the country would be facing extensive Germanization programmes, and their ruler would be Adolf Pilar von Pilchau, who is a native Baltic-German. The United Baltic Duchy are currently being more and more integrated with the German mainland, which has caused many protests and instability in the nation. Russia is also growing stronger and is eyeing up the state, with the goal to annex them."
 POL_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Poland became independent after Germany was victorious in the Great war. While Poland is closely ties with Germany, this is only economically, as they are practically a German economic satellite. Politically, they enjoy a lot more freedoms. \n\nThe Bulgarian Prince of Preslav Kiril would become the country's ruler. This was very popular as Kiril was a Slav and a Catholic, which is better for the Polish people than a Protestant German or a Catholic Habsburg. \n\nStill, there are efforts by Austria to get Poland on their side, with the promises to give them the entirety of Galicia if they end up doing so. Poland is in a vulnarable state, as although they are internally stable, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Illyria, but also Russia are eyeing them up for a potential expansion. \n\nThe Polish nation needs to choose a side in the upcoming Greater War as they need to secure their full political and economic independence."
 EGY_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Egyptians were under the grip of the British Empire, but in 1921 they saw an opportunity to break free. This was due to the Ottoman Empire calling for a Jihad against the former Entente members of France, Britian, and Russia. The Egyptians would border the Ottoman Empire, so this made their war of independence a lot easier. Still, the British would not allow for the Suez Canal to fall to Egypt, hence why the British occupied it and later got to keep it. \n\nEgypt was politically united, as they would be led by the Wafd Party, which was nationalist and liberal. The Egyptians were quite tolerant of different religions, which is very well represented in their flag. This allowed Egypt to get the Palestine region after the Wars of Ottoman Collapse, despite them not participating in the war. This happened because Germany didn't want to give the Jewish Holy Land to the United Arab State. \n\nThe Egyptians are firmly in the German sphere of influence as a result of them granting free land to Egypt, but also the Egyptians are anti-British and want to remain as an independent country, to which Germany would aid them."
 AUS_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Austrian Empire was the one to start the Great war, but despite this, they didn't gain a whole lot. The fact of the matter was that the Austrian portion was broke economically. \n\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire was reformed to include a South Slavic Crown of Illyria, which in the process took Hungarian Croatia and the Hungarian access to the sea. This was a big deal, as the Hungarians would demand compensation. \n\nTo make matters for them even worse, Hungary had been demanding either monetary or territorial compensation, which the Austrian portion just couldn't grant at the time. This is because Austria is focused on allying with Poland and giving them Galicia as a compensation. If they were to pay the Hungarians, this would prevent Austria to economically get Poland onto their side. \n\nIn recent years, Hungary has been more vocal in demanding compensation. Austria is at a crossroad where they need to choose either to keep Hungary or Illyria, but trying to keep both would make it difficult for the Empire to remain united."
 HUN_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Hungarians as part of Austria-Hungary joined the Great war as to support their Austrian partners. The problem was that their side came out on top of the war, so Hungary was victorious. \n\nDespite this, Austria wanted to reform and to create a South Slavic Crown of Illyria, which would include the Hungarian portions of Croatia, as well as the Hungarian access to the sea. Hungary agreed to grant these lands, but demanded compensation, either in the form of money or land abroad. \n\nThe Austrian portion would be too stubborn and it would take a decade of no compensation that would antagonize the Hungarians. \n\nIn their eyes, the Hungarians joined the war to support Austria, then they proceeded to win the Great war, but they still lost territory. This is why understandably the Hungarians are becoming more radical and request that Austria helps them invade Romania, which would be a compensation for Hungarian Croatia. \n\nSince the Austrians have denied this, the Hungarian portion is starting to think of abandoning Austria and seizing their reparations in other ways."
 YUG_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Illyria was created in 1921, where the Hungarians willingly gave up on their portions of Croatia, as well as the Hungarian access to the sea, with some eventual compensation in return. \n\nThe Illyrian crown is the poorest of the Empire, so they cannot affort pay the Hungarians. If they were to pay Hungary for their portions of Croatia, this can bankrupt Illyria, which would radicalize them further and calls for leaving the Emprie would be possible. \n\nThe Illyrians were also promised eventually to annex Serbia-Montenegro, but this still looks like a distant dream. The problem is that Italy is eyeing up the Illyrian Kingdom, as the Italians claim many of it's lands. It looks like Illyria is a Frankenstein State, where nobody gets along and nobody asked for it to exist. Only time will tell what would happen to them."
 SER_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The Serbians initiated the Great war, but to their demise Bulgaria joined the opposing side and Serbia and Montenegro were quickly overran. After the war, they became economic and political satelites of the Habsburg monarchy. \n\nThis is well seen in their leader, which is Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria, a quite incompetent leader, but she was put there on purpose. The goal of Austria was to eventually overthrow Elisabeth Marie and annex Serbia-Montenegro into the kingdom of Illyria. \n\nThe problem was that Austria-Hungary reformed and created a South Slavic crown called Illyria, but Serbia-Montenegro was not allowed to join initially. The Serbo-Montenegrin nation is also on the chopping block, as Bulgaria and Albania were secretly promised to partition the country, with the aid of Greece. \n\nThe main goal of Serbia-Montenegro is to secure their independence and prevent other countries from partitioning them, which would be a though task."
 USA_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "The US has largely been the same for a few decades, as we did not have any role to play in the Great War. \n\nIn the Post war world, our Role didn't really change immedietly, as we were Neutral for all of the war. \n\nWith Wilson Losing 1916, the Republicans regained the dominanace over the white house and are in control of it over the last 14 years. \n\nIsolationism is still strong as it used to be. as the US is largely internal focused as we aim to continue economic growth. \n\nIn 1928 the American Economy became the largest one in the world due to our Succeseful economic policies including Prohobition, De-regulation and more. \n\nIn terms of diplomacy, we have aimed to keep ties with all, though Curtis wishes to improve ties with the British Empire, and benefit from Canadian trade. We oppose the Japanese, but we do not have much conflict with them, outside of supporting Chinese republicans."
 JAP_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "With our joining of great war, we were hoping for a quick victory in the pacific front. \n\nInstead Great war was a disaster for Japan. The attempted invasion of Papua new guinea caused many caputred while the Invasion of Qingdau was a complete faliure. In most naval engagement we lost to the Kriegsmarine's submarines. \n\nWhile not long that many lands to the Central powers in the Frankfurt peace deals, one thing it did lose is prestige. \n\nWe tried to promote the idea that the Japanese people are equal to Europeans but the great war put a major roadblock for it. The economy entered into a decline from 1917-1924 and the final straw was the poor handleing of the 1923 earthquake. \n\n With that the army and navy got disgredicted to the Point that the Socialist party won the elections and had seized power. \n\nWe had started the process of democratization and while that was not that good, we did improve the country. With our rule being solidified two main question are raised, Question of the Monarchy and of Foreign policy. We shall see in the upcoming years the answer to both questions."
 ROM_NEW_DECADE_DESC:0 "Romania was neutral during the Great war. We Stayed neutral and it payed off for us, We had managaged to Get Moldova in Exchange for giving up only parts of Dobruja. So now, we are at the crossroads, deciding what path to take next. \n\nThe economic situation in our country hasn’t been great ever since the end of the war. However, global trade is increasing and since our vast reserves of iron ore and oil will be enticing to other countries, we believe the economy will rapidly increase in size. \n\nAlthough staying neutral, Romania still has the largest and perhaps the strongest military in the Balkans. We can use this to show our strength and get what we want. \n\nThe governing party Romania is the newly formed National Peasant’s Party. It was formed in 1926 through the fusion of the Romanian National Party, a conservative-regionalist party centered on Transylvania, and the Peasant’s Party, a left-leaning agrarian party that coalesced the left-leaning movement in Bessarabia and the Old Kingdom. Both parties agreed on the concept of a “Peasant State”  which proposed voluntary cooperative farming as the basis of the economy. These parties also believed that small holding should be protected from state capitalism or state socialism. The peasants are believed to be the first defense of Romanian nationalism and of the country’s monarchic regime. \n\nNow, in 1930 we are in a major crossroads moment, Austia's collapse seems immenent and Hungary might attempt an invasion, what shall Romania's fate be?"
